Application landing zone management approach | Description
--- | --- |
Central team management | A central IT team fully operates the landing zone. The team applies controls and platform tools to the platform and application landing zones.	
Application team management | A platform administration team delegates the entire application landing zone to an application team. The application team manages and supports the environment. The management group policies ensure that the platform team still governs the application landing zone. You can add other policies at the subscription scope and use alternative tooling for deploying, securing, or monitoring application landing zones.
Shared management | With technology platforms such as AKS or AVS, a central IT team manages the underlying service. The application teams are responsible for the applications running on top of the technology platforms. You need to use different controls or access permissions for this model. These controls and permissions differ from the ones you use to manage application landing zones centrally.
