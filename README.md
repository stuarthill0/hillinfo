SAP S/4HANA Lines of Business

With the advent of SAP S/4HANA, SAP ECC modules were reorganized into “lines of business” (LoB) that better match business operations. Let’s dive into each.
SAP S/4HANA Finance

The SAP S/4HANA Finance LoB focuses on all money-related activities of a business. This includes financial accounting, controlling, treasury and risk management, financial planning, financial close, and consolidation.
 
SAP S/4HANA Finance functionality encompasses the FI, CO, TRM, IM, and FSCM legacy modules. Other SAP solutions related to finance, such as SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management and SAP Analytics Cloud, are not included with SAP S/4HANA licenses but are available for purchase to supplement the core system.
 
Those that don’t want to move all of their business operations to SAP S/4HANA but want to take advantage of the benefits of SAP S/4HANA Finance may find the Central Finance deployment option attractive. This implements SAP S/4HANA Finance alongside your existing ERP stack.
SAP S/4HANA Sourcing and Procurement

The SAP S/4HANA Sourcing and Procurement LoB focuses on the activities surrounding the obtainment of raw materials needed to fulfill orders. This includes extended procurement, operational purchasing, and supplier and contract management.
 
SAP S/4HANA Sourcing and Procurement functionality encompasses the SRM and MM legacy modules. Other cloud SAP solutions related to sourcing, like SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass, are not included with SAP S/4HANA licenses but are available to supplement the core system.
SAP S/4HANA Manufacturing

The SAP S/4HANA Manufacturing LoB focuses on the product creation process. This includes responsive manufacturing, production operations, scheduling and delivery planning, and quality management.
 
SAP S/4HANA Manufacturing functionality encompasses the PP and QM legacy modules.
SAP S/4HANA Supply Chain

The SAP S/4HANA Supply Chain LoB focuses on overall business planning activities, from pre-planning production runs to dispatching products to purchasers. This includes production planning, batch traceability, warehousing, inventory, and transportation management.
 
SAP S/4HANA Supply Chain functionality encompasses the TM, EWM, and PP legacy modules.
SAP S/4HANA Asset Management

The SAP S/4HANA Asset Management LoB focuses on the maintenance of a business’ fixed assets, from tools and machinery all the way up to buildings. This includes plant maintenance and EHS monitoring.
 
SAP S/4HANA Asset Management functionality encompasses the PM legacy module.
SAP S/4HANA Sales

The SAP S/4HANA Sales LoB focuses on the activities associated with the fulfilling sales orders. This includes pricing, sales inquiries and quotes, sales contracts and agreements, free-of-charge orders, available-to-promise checks, incompletion checks, repair orders, individual requirements, return authorizations, credit and debit memo requests, picking and packing, billing, and revenue recognition.
 
SAP S/4HANA Sales functionality encompasses the SD and CRM legacy modules.
SAP S/4HANA R&D/Engineering

The SAP S/4HANA R&D LoB focuses on the lifecycle of a product. This includes defining the product structure and bill of materials, product lifecycle costing, managing portfolios and projects, managing innovation, managing chemical data and other sensitive materials used in development, and staying compliant with safety and health regulations.
 
SAP S/4HANA R&D/Engineering functionality encompasses the PLM legacy module.
 
SAP SCM: SAP Supply Chain Management functionality was added directly to the core of SAP S/4HANA and can be found all throughout the four logistics LoBs. Advanced planning and optimization is now performed via SAP Integrated Business Planning, and advanced warehousing functionality beyond the standard is available via an additional license.
SAP PS: SAP Project System still exists as a project management tool for users of SAP S/4HANA. It is supplemented by new project integrations in the SAP S/4HANA suite (SAP Portfolio and Project Management and SAP Commercial Project Management) to provide a holistic project management solution.
SAP HCM: SAP Human Capital Management does not have a 1:1 analog in SAP S/4HANA. Rather, SAP has focused on more tightly integrating the SAP SuccessFactors cloud HR suite with SAP S/4HANA to handle all human resources tasks.
Industry solutions: Some of the industry-specific functionality of the SAP ERP industry modules has been baked directly into the core SAP S/4HANA solution. Other functionality has been moved into SAP Customer Experience, SAP Ariba, and SAP Customer Activity Repository.
